Kim
You are sunlight and i moon
Joined by the gods of fortune
Midnight and high noon
Sharing the sky
We have been blessed, you and i

Chris
You are here like a mystery
I'm from a world that's so different
From all that you are
How in the light of one night
Did we come so far?

Kim
Outside day starts to dawn

Chris
Your moon still floats on high

Kim
The birds awake

Chris
The stars shine too

Kim
My hands still shake

Chris
I reach for you

Both
And we meet in the sky!

Kim
You are sunlight and i moon
Joined here
Bright'ning the sky
With the flame
Of love

Both
Made of
Sunlight
Moonlight

Kim
Tomorrow will be the full moon
I can bring friends to bless our room
With paper unicorns and perfume
If you want me to

Chris
Unicorns? sure. . .
