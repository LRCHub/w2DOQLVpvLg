The snakes, they can crawl
And the cheetahs, they can bawl
And their ghosts can wait for the hereafter

But if you are so proud
As to say that's not allowed
We will get sick and choke ourselves with laughter

And the girlfriends that you knew
To whom you promised to be true
We'll have their sisters hanging from the rafters
And every dirty shade
Will rise rotting from its grave
Tomorrow will be just like the day after

Oh, and this bitter desert wind
Will come ripping through your skin
And everything that's calm will turn to madness

And all of your false tears
Come whirling down the years
What was kind and warm will come to sadness

And the sun and the moon
Will come begging at your door
The stars will turn to rust, drop from the skies

And everybody soon
Will be asking you for more
And everybody will be telling lies

And the girlfriends that you knew
To whom you promised to be true
We'll have their sisters hanging from the rafters

And every dirty shade
Will rise rotting from the grave
Tomorrow will be just like the day after
Yeah

And the girlfriends that you knew
To whom you promised to be true
We'll have their sisters hanging from the rafters

And every dirty shade
Will rise rotting from its grave
Tomorrow will be just like the day after

Tomorrow will be just like the day after
Tomorrow will be just like the day after
Tomorrow will be just like the day after
