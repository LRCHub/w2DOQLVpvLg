Think I lied
This was the happiest I'd been in a while
You were the sun, I was the moon
Wish this didn't have to end so soon
You kissed my head and I felt myself fall in two
I can't sleep because I thought I finally found you
I would get up if I could but nightmares are always where I end up
A constant hum that i'm not good enough
