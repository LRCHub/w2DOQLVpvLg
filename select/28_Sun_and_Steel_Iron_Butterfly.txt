I get up when I feel too weak
And the words I try to speak
A desire to be in the peak of the feel

I move on and the cards they fall
My hand had its last call
Don't you know that I'm bettin' at all on the wheel

The battle cry, the wind has blown
The cause is need to throw back the stones
And I'm fallin'
Yes, I'm fallin'
To the sun and the steel

I get up out of more than need
By the sword I live and breathe
Don't you know that I'm plantin' my seeds on the run

I move on and the charge is called
Ten to one as I hit the wall
Honors won when my flag stands tall in the sun.

The battle cry, the wind has blown
The cause is need to throw back the stones
And I'm fallin'
Yes, I'm fallin'
To the sun and the steel
