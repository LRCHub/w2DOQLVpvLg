Seems like it's been forever
Since we had time to breathe
Let's break on out livin'
Spinnin' out a breakneck speed
I don't care about what the time is
Or where this road will lead
I'm grateful cause when I'm with you
You know I got all I need

Right here
All my troubles disappear
Like when I'm looking in your eyes
And I can see things crystal clear, my dear and

Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come round and
Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come back around
Come back around
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon

I'm not worried about yesterday
Today, or about tomorrow
When I hold you in my arms
I feel the healin' of my sorrows
Just fall away like dry leaves turn to petals in the spring
The magic that you bring unlocks that thing inside of me
My baby

Right here
All my troubles disappear
Like when I'm looking in your eyes
And I can see things crystal clear, my dear and

Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come round and
Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come back around
Come back around
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon

I believe we can find love in this life
That we can ignite
I believe we can be stars in the night
That's brighter than bright
I believe there is a love in this life
That we can ignite
And that's why I'll be by your side through this life
Alright

Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come round and
Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon
Oh way oh, oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come round and
Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come back around
Come back around
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come back around
Come back around
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon
Oh way oh, oh way oh way oh
You know I love you every day and night
Just like the sun and moon come back around
