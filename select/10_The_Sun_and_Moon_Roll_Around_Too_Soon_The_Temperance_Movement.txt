I know the sun and moon,
They roll around too soon now,
Good luck,
Good luck

I take my morning salvation,
Slow from my Jerusalem,
Cup,
Straight up

On the tones in my bones,
From the last time,
You sell your truth,
And I will sell you mine,

Right or wrong,
Is a long end to waste time,
Fill up on love,
And other medicine

I hear you wanted some more,
I only wanted whats yours,
I hear you wanted some more,
I hope you're getting low

And when the last cycle ceases,
I'm sweeping up the pieces,
Of you,
They're few

I called and in spite of speeches,
I ordered up some peaches,
And cream,
Obscene

On the tones in my bones,
From the last time,
You sell your truth,
And I will sell you mine,

Right or wrong,
Is a long end to waste time,
Fill up on love,
And other medicine

I hear you wanted some more,
I only wanted whats yours,
I hear you wanted some more,
I hope you're getting low

Come lay me wrong,
I'll lay me me right,
Come blame it all,
We'll satisfy

I hear you wanted some more,
I only wanted whats yours,
I hear you wanted some more,
I hope you're getting low

On the tones in my bones,
From the last time,
You sell your truth,
And I will sell you mine,

I hear you wanted some more,
I hope you're getting low
